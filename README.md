# Linters Set-Up

> Linters are used for keeping a code that is in sync with best code practices


## Built With

- Major languages
- Frameworks
- Technologies used

## Getting Started
   ### Usage
  A linter is a tool that analyzes your source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs(source: Wikipedia).

   #### There are a few reasons for using linters:

   - Catching syntax errors is more efficient. There is no need to debug simple mistakes like typos - the linter does it for you.
   - The entire codebase looks like written by one person.
   - Programmers can focus on solving problems, instead of cleaning up the code.
